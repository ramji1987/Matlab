Bins and Marbles
3. We have 2 opaque bags, each containing 2 balls. One bag has 2 black balls and
the other has a black ball and a white ball. You pick a bag at random and
then pick one of the balls in that bag at random. When you look at the ball,
it is black. You now pick the second ball from that same bag. What is the
probability that this ball is also black?

Solution: 
function op = classify_x1aligned(X,slope,c)
x2 = (slope * X(1)) + c;
if(X(2) > x2) 
    op = +1;
else
    op = -1;
end
return;
